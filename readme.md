# Style transfer program with tensorflow and python
This repository provides a notebook for applying style transfer using a content and a styling image. You can use whatever image you desire.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your workspace <br>
```!git clone https://github.com/Nifdi01/style-transfer.git```
2. Download the necessary dependencies which are show below:
  * Tensorflow
  * Tensorflow Hub
  * Matplotlib
  * Numpy
  * OpenCV

You can run the below code to download all the necessary libraries:<br>
```!pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub matplotlib numpy opencv-python```

You can now use the model to stylize your images.
